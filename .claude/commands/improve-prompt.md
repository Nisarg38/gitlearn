$ARGUMENTS

## Improvement Process

Apply these techniques systematically:

### 1. Structure Analysis
- Identify missing components from the 10-component framework
- Check for: Task Context, Tone, Background Data, Detailed Task, Examples, Conversation History, Immediate Task, Step-by-Step Thinking, Output Format, Prefilled Response

### 2. Clarity Enhancement
- Replace vague language with precise instructions
- Add explicit constraints and boundaries
- Define success criteria clearly

### 3. Context Addition
- Add relevant background information
- Explain the WHY behind the request
- Include domain-specific context

### 4. XML Structure
- Wrap distinct sections in semantic XML tags
- Use `<task>`, `<context>`, `<constraints>`, `<examples>`, `<output_format>` as needed

### 5. Chain of Thought
- Add reasoning steps where complex thinking is required
- Use "Think step by step" or "Let's work through this" directives

### 6. Output Specification
- Define exact output format (JSON, markdown, etc.)
- Specify length, style, and structure
- Include example outputs when helpful

## Output Format

Provide the improved prompt in this structure:

```markdown
## Improved Prompt

[The enhanced prompt with all improvements applied]

## Changes Made
- [List each improvement and why it helps]

## Usage Tips
- [Any recommendations for using this prompt effectively]
```

Now analyze and improve the provided prompt with maximum effectiveness.
