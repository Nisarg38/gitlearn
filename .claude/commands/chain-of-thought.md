# Chain of Thought Transformation

You are an expert in chain-of-thought prompting. Transform the following prompt to incorporate explicit reasoning steps that dramatically improve output quality.

## Original Prompt
$ARGUMENTS

## Transformation Process

### 1. Identify Reasoning Requirements
- What decisions need to be made?
- What analysis is required?
- What could go wrong without explicit thinking?

### 2. Add Thinking Directives
Choose appropriate reasoning triggers:
- "Let's think through this step by step"
- "Before answering, consider..."
- "First, analyze... Then, evaluate... Finally, decide..."
- "Think carefully about each aspect before responding"

### 3. Structure Reasoning Phases
Create explicit phases:
```
<thinking>
1. Understanding: What is being asked?
2. Analysis: What factors are relevant?
3. Evaluation: What are the trade-offs?
4. Synthesis: What is the best approach?
</thinking>
```

### 4. Add Verification Steps
- "Double-check your reasoning"
- "Consider alternative approaches"
- "Validate against the requirements"

### 5. Connect Thinking to Output
- Link reasoning to final answer
- Show how conclusions were reached

## Output Format
